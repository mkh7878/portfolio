# Meaghan Horak's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio website! It was built using a combination of Bootstrap, Jekyll, HTML, and CSS. 

The website is live here [Meaghan's Portfolio Site](https://meaghanhorak.com).

## Features

- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and layout.
- **Jekyll**: For managing and building static site content.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the website.

## Chatbot Project

In addition to my portfolio, I have developed a chatbot powered by AI that is trained on my resume. You can explore the chatbot and its source code here: [Chatbot Project](https://github.com/mkh7878/meaghan-resume).

Feel free to browse through the portfolio and explore the chatbot to get a better sense of my work and skills. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out! Meaghan.horak@gmail.com
